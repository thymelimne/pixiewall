TODO:

- Butterflies: Make more butterflies happen -- it's kind of scarce with the butterflies atm.
- Butterflies: Make it so that the butterflies are more likely to come toward the center of the screen.
- Silhouettes: Transition into it better, rather than a flash-intro.
	- Idea: Fade into it from gray?
	- Idea: Grow into it? Maybe it erodes too much at first, then less, until it reaches the desired amount? So, it'll be like shapes grow.
X- Refactor: Make it a multi-file package structure.
- Silhouettes: Change the color of the silhouette from just plain white.
- Silhouettes: Add spellcasting. (Via Conway's Game of Life, or something similar?)
X- Bug: Transitions: Make it so that Silhouettes actually can go back to Butterflies.
    X- Attempt: It seems that it does go back to Butterflies, but then just immediately goes back to Silhouettes.

For the project in general, non-SW:

- Make sure the RaspPi can execute the .py file upon reboot, without me needing to interact with it.
- Construct a holding stick for the camera, to safely dangle it over the wall.
- Construct a makeshift ammo box for the two Rasp Pis, with a power splitter inside, to power them and also have both Ethernet and USB-A wires coming out of it.
- Fix the flickering light currently on that wall.
	- Climb atop the manifold.
	- Unplug & replug lights until you find the one that's flickering. Mark that with pink or green marking tape.
	- Try to ameliorate the issue with that string...
		- Check for any visible errors on the wire.
		- Try a signal repeater.
		- Replace a wire, if you can.
		- If still it doesn't work right, simply leave it unplugged and move on.
- Make sure that the FPP-videoCapture works.
    - Test it in the office, with the Raspbian HDMI stream input, to the f16v3 pixel controller.
- Make sure that the FPP can connect in the "Ice Castles Staff" Wi-Fi.
    - Test it in the workshop.
- Take the completed box and plug it into the manifold's pixel controller.
    - Try it, completely plugged in, see what happens.
    - If there's an issue with that, try troubleshooting it via laptop connection.
        - Might need a partner for this... If it's raining, I'll need to use my laptop indoors, and radio them to ask them what they see on the wall... I'd have them stand there.
- Set it up so that the FPP RaspPi can alternate between this program and other FPP programs. (David's assignment)
