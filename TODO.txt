TODO:

- Butterflies: Make more butterflies happen -- it's kind of scarce with the butterflies atm.
- Butterflies: Make it so that the butterflies are more likely to come toward the center of the screen.
- Silhouettes: Transition into it better, rather than a flash-intro.
    - Idea: Fade into it from gray?
    - Idea: Grow into it? Maybe it erodes too much at first, then less, until it reaches the desired amount? So, it'll be like shapes grow.
- Refactor: Make it a multi-file package structure.
- Silhouettes: Change the color of the silhouette from just plain white.
- Silhouettes: Add spellcasting. (Via Conway's Game of Life, or something similar?)
- Bug: Transitions: Make it so that Silhouettes actually can go back to Butterflies.
